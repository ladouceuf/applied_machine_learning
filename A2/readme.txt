Here is a breif description of what each file contains:

-A2.1: 		#1 of A2. Output the datasets in "out\A2.1\"
-A2.2: 		#2 of A2 (LDA). The best fit coefficients print.
-A2.3:	 	#3 of A2 (k-NN). You can vary the number of near neighbours by changing the CONSTANT K_NEI.
-A2.4: 		#4 of A2. Output the datasets in "out\A2.4\"
-A2.5-1: 	#5, part 1 of A2(LDA) 
-A2.5-2: 	#5, part 2 of A2 (k-NN)

-out:	-A2.1:	-Contains the synthetic dataset constructed in A2.1.
	-A2.3:	-Contains:	-DS1_test_pred, which contains the prediction of the 1200 test datapoints(A2.3).
				-perf_mes, which contains the performance results of the test (A2.3). 
	-A2.4:	-Contains the synthetic dataset constructed in A2.4.
	-A2.5-2:-Contains:	-DS2_test_pred, which contains the prediction of the 1200 test datapoints(A2.5-2).
				-perf_mes, which contains the performance results of the test (A2.5-2).
